# Terminal_Chatting_App
This is my first project, I know it will have a lot of issues in designing and in optimisation and a lot of things that I am not even aware of right now. But it is a start, fresh and optimistic.
Here you can make an account and send friend requests to other users and have a nice chat with them this is only a prototype ofc. But from here we can begin.
Thank You.

Here are the libraries you will need to import in python to run this, Enter these commands in your Terminal-
- pip install sys
- pip install csv
- pip install json
- pip install bcrypt
- pip install os
